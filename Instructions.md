4\) Plot in 2D. Select between PCA and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, adjust parameters for UMAP if selected. Hit bang to plot, the result is shown in the graph in the middle of the patch. 

5\) Plot 3D. Start with the default parameters: xyz, and scale of 1000 units for each axis.

6\) Turn the audio on, click and drag cursor on the graph to activate different slices and test the audio output.

7\) Select a preset in the movement preset area.
